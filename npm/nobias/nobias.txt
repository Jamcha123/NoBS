I understand you're interested in identifying logical fallacies within the transcript of Asmongold's video titled "Something insane happened today." However, I don't have access to the full transcript of this specific video. Without the complete content, it's challenging to accurately pinpoint and analyze the presence of the listed fallacies.

**Common Logical Fallacies:**

1. **Strawman Fallacy:** Misrepresenting an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack.
2. **False Cause Fallacy:** Assuming that because two events occur together, one causes the other.
3. **Slippery Slope Fallacy:** Asserting that a relatively small first step will inevitably lead to a chain of related (usually negative) events.
4. **Personal Incredulity Fallacy:** Asserting that because something is difficult to understand, it's not true.
5. **Loaded Question Fallacy:** Asking a question that contains a controversial or unjustified assumption.
6. **The Gambler's Fallacy:** Believing that past random events affect the probabilities in future random events.
7. **Appeal to Authority Fallacy:** Relying on the opinion of an authority who is not an expert in the relevant field.
8. **Appeal to Emotion Fallacy:** Manipulating an emotional response in place of a valid argument.
9. **Genetic Fallacy:** Judging something as good or bad based on where it comes from.
10. **Begging the Question Fallacy:** Presenting a circular argument where the conclusion is included in the premise.
11. **Bandwagon Fallacy:** Arguing that something is true or good simply because it's popular.
12. **Ambiguity Fallacy:** Using a double meaning or ambiguity to mislead or misrepresent the truth.
13. **Burden of Proof Fallacy:** Asserting that a claim is true because it hasn't been proven false.
14. **Composition/Division Fallacy:** Assuming that what's true for a part is true for the whole, or vice versa.
15. **False Equivalence Fallacy:** Drawing an equivalence between two things based on flawed or false reasoning.
16. **Appeal to Nature Fallacy:** Arguing that something is good because it's natural, or bad because it's unnatural.
17. **The Fallacy Fallacy:** Assuming that because an argument contains a fallacy, its conclusion must be false.
18. **No True Scotsman Fallacy:** Dismissing counterexamples to a claim by redefining the criteria.
19. **Lump of Labour Fallacy:** Assuming that there is a fixed amount of work to be done, leading to the belief that jobs can be "taken" in a zero-sum manner.
20. **Red Herring Fallacy:** Introducing irrelevant material to the argument to distract and lead away from the point being made.

**Fact-Checking Using Google:**

To fact-check statements made in the video, you can:

1. **Identify Key Claims:** Note specific assertions or statements made in the video.
2. **Use Reliable Sources:** Search for these claims using reputable news outlets, academic publications, or official reports.
3. **Cross-Reference Information:** Compare the information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy.
4. **Check Dates and Context:** Ensure that the information is current and relevant to the context of the claim.

If you can provide specific excerpts or claims from the video, I'd be happy to help analyze them for logical fallacies and assist with fact-checking.
