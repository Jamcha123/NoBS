# NoBias - Don't be fooled easily

NoBias is a youtube bias detector that helps you with fact checking and fallacy finding.

How it works:
  
    1. It first gets the Youtube video description and transcript using the Youtube API.
     
    2. Then it gets data from other websites using the Google Search API and scraping sites like https://www.wikipedia.org, https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com and other news sites
     
    3. Lastly it using AI to cross reference the Youtube video transcript and description with a broad dataset from the internet and see if it is bias.

Political Summary Options:
  
    1. Left Wing Summarizes (e.g social justice, equality and welfare)
  
    2. Right Wing Summarizes (e.g personal responsibility, economic growth, low taxes and deregulation)
  
    3. Centrist Summarizes (e.g compromise, data driven, left wing and right wing mixed approach)
     
    4. Purely Data Driven Summarizes (e.g from Wikipedia, yourlogicalfallacyis, google search API, government data and etc.)

It can also see how many fallacies the video creator made during the video.

It can also detect certain loaded terms like fascist, communist, greedy, blaming groups (e.g the rich or migrants) without nuance.

Hope you enjoy NoBias and you avoid becoming polarized and ideologically rigid.
