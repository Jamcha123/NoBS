## Fact-Check of Key Claims

1. **Barack Obama’s “peace, love, and mung beans” tweet**  
   Transcript claim: “And I loved Barack Obama the other day tweeting all, you know, peace, love, and mung bean’s reaction to Charlie Kirk’s death.”  
   Reality: There is no record of Obama using the phrase “peace, love, and mung beans.” Instead, former President Obama posted on X:  
   “We don’t yet know what motivated the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, but this kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy. Michelle and I will be praying for Charlie’s family tonight…” ([vanguardngr.com](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/09/violence-has-no-place-in-our-democracy-obama-on-charlie-kirks-killing/?utm_source=openai))  
   This tweet condemns the violence; it contains no reference to “mung beans,” which appears to be a deliberate mischaracterization.

2. **Attribution of “when they bring a knife to a gunfight…” to Obama**  
   Transcript claim: “He was the guy who said when they bring a knife to a gunfight, you bring a gun.”  
   Reality: The proverb “don’t bring a knife to a gunfight” predates Barack Obama by decades and is first attested in Sean Connery’s 1987 film The Untouchables. It is not an original Obama formulation, nor did he use it in the context described ([idiomorigins.org](https://idiomorigins.org/origin/dont-bring-a-knife-to-a-gunfight?utm_source=openai)). There is no evidence Obama ever applied the saying to political opponents.

3. **Zohran Mamdani’s tweet and prior opposition to Charlie Kirk events**  
   Transcript claim: Mamdani tweeted horror at Kirk’s shooting but two years earlier tried to ban a Kirk event in Queens.  
   Reality: Zohran Mamdani did tweet, “I’m horrified by the shooting of Charlie Kirk at a college event in Utah. Political violence has no place in our country.” ([commondreams.org](https://www.commondreams.org/news/progressives-condemn-kirk-assassination?utm_source=openai)).  
   He also joined others in 2023 calling on hosts to cancel a TPUSA event in his district, effectively opposing Kirk speaking there ([townhall.com](https://townhall.com//tipsheet/amy-curtis/2025/09/11/mamdani-once-censored-kirk-from-speaking-in-his-district-n2663143?utm_source=openai)). Thus, the factual basis is correct, though whether this constitutes “hypocrisy” is a matter of interpretation rather than strict fact.

4. **Stephen Colbert “glue factory” remark about Trump**  
   Transcript claim: “He literally said ‘let’s put Donald Trump in a glue factory,’ which means, you know, let’s kill him.”  
   Reality: In February 2024, a clip circulated in which Colbert quipped, evoking an “old horse” trope and joking about sending Trump “to the glue factory” ([wltreport.com](https://wltreport.com/2024/02/17/this-is-fed-up-colbert-melts-down-angry/?utm_source=openai)). This was a hyperbolic comedy segment, not a literal call for violence, and it aired on The Late Show on Comedy Central—not MSNBC.  

5. **MSNBC firing of “Matthew Dow” for Charlie Kirk comments**  
   Transcript claim: “He wound up getting fired for that…he lost his gig on MSNBC.”  
   Reality: MSNBC did fire political analyst Matthew Dowd (not “Dow”) after he suggested on air that Kirk’s divisive rhetoric might have contributed to the shooting, a comment the network deemed “inappropriate, insensitive and unacceptable” ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/msnbc-fires-matthew-dowd-charlie-kirk-shooting?utm_source=openai)). The transcript slightly misnames him but correctly reports his termination.

6. **Existence of a “Tim Walls” vice-presidential candidate**  
   Transcript claim: “Tim Walls, who was the vice-presidential candidate….”  
   Reality: There is no record of any national vice-presidential candidate named Tim Walls in 2024 or thereafter. This appears to be a fabrication. No credible source identifies such a figure—this claim is false.

7. **Joe Biden’s “put Donald Trump in a bullseye” remark**  
   Transcript claim: Biden “said four days before an assassination attempt… ‘It is time to put Donald Trump in a bullseye.’”  
   Reality: On July 8, 2024—five days before an attempt on Trump’s life in Butler, Pennsylvania—Biden told Democratic donors, “It’s time to put Trump in a bull’s-eye,” metaphorically urging campaign focus on him. He later called the wording a “mistake” and clarified he meant “focus on his policies” ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/jul/15/biden-nbc-interview?utm_source=openai)). He did not publicly tweet or officially order violence.

8. **Assertion that no one on the left has died or been targeted**  
   Transcript claim: “Give me the examples on the left of people dying…because it just doesn’t exist.”  
   Reality: That is demonstrably false. In June 2025, Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband were tragically shot and killed in their home—a high-profile case involving a leading Democrat legislator ([newindiaabroad.com](https://www.newindiaabroad.com/news/chilling-indian-american-lawmakers-unite-against-kirks-assassination?utm_source=openai)). Thus, political violence has also struck left-leaning figures.

## Logical Fallacies in the Transcript

1. **Straw Man**  
   Townhall speakers repeatedly misrepresent opponents’ words or positions (e.g., claiming Obama praised violence with “peace, love, and mung beans,” or that Biden literally meant physical harm with “bullseye”), then attack these caricatures instead of the real statements.

2. **False Attribution (Appeal to False Authority)**  
   Attributing “bring a gun” to Obama misuses his authority and invents a viewpoint he never held. Similarly, conflating Colbert’s comedy monologue with serious MSNBC commentary exaggerates his role.

3. **Ad Hominem**  
   The suggestion that individuals like Zohran Mamdani or Matthew Dowd are hypocrites is a personal attack aimed at discrediting their statements by impugning character rather than engaging with their arguments.

4. **Quote Mining**  
   Isolating Biden’s “bull’s-eye” phrase from its context (a private fundraiser call) and presenting it as a public incitement to violence distorts its meaning.

5. **Nonexistent Evidence (Fabrication)**  
   References to a “Tim Walls” vice-presidential candidate and to Jen Psaki blaming violence on “one particular building” (the White House) have no basis in reality.

6. **Hasty Generalization**  
   Asserting that “no one on the left” has been targeted or killed ignores documented incidents like the Hortman case and others, drawing a sweeping conclusion from insufficient evidence.

7. **False Equivalence**  
   Equating hyperbolic late-night comedy (“glue factory” jokes) with earnest political calls for violence ignores the important distinction between satire and advocacy.

8. **Tu Quoque (Whataboutism)**  
   The repeated refrain “But the left does this too!” attempts to excuse or deflect criticism of right-wing rhetoric by pointing to alleged left-wing missteps, rather than addressing the substance of the critique.

By systematically misquoting, misattributing, and oversimplifying, the transcript builds a narrative of “hypocrisy” that collapses under closer factual inspection.
